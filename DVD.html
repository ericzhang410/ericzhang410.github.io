<h3>What Is A DVD?</h3>
<!--Paragraph-->
<p>DVD is a digital optical disc storage format invented and developed in 1995 and released in late 1996.
 The medium can store any kind of digital data and is widely used for software and other computer files as well as video programs watched using DVD players.

<h3>How a DVD works</h3>
<!--Paragraph-->
<p>Digital versatile discs (DVDs) can store more information than compact discs (CDs) because they have smaller pits, placed closer together. 
It is the pattern of these pits burned onto a disc's surface that encodes the 1's and 0's a player translates into sound and/or images.

<h3>Parts</h3>
<!--Paragraph-->
<p><b>Polycarbonate (Plastic) Substrate Layer</b>-The polycarbonate substrate makes up most of the disc, including the area that is read by the laser (opposite the label side on CDs).
 It is present on both sides of a DVD, even a “single-sided” disc with a label on one side.
 <br>
 <b>Data Layer</b>-As its name implies, the data layer of CDs and DVDs is the layer that contains the data. The data appear as marks or pits that either absorb light from the laser beam, or transmit the light back to the laser photosensor by way of the metal reflective layer. 
 <br>
 <b>Metal Layer in RW, ROM, and RAM Discs</b>-The metal layer in optical discs reflects the laser beam back to the laser photosensor in the laser head. Three types of reflective metals are typically used for this layer: aluminum, gold, and silver or silver alloy.
