<h2>Solid State Drive</h2>
<h3>What Is A SSD?</h3>
<!--Paragraph-->
<p>Stands for "Solid State Drive." An SSD is a type of mass storage device similar to a hard
 disk drive (HDD). It supports reading and writing data and maintains stored data in a permanent
 state even without power. Internal SSDs connect to a computer like a hard drive, using standard IDE or SATA connections

<h3>How an SSD works</h3>
<!--Paragraph-->
<p>Known as a solid-state drive, or SSD, it uses semiconductor chips, not magnetic 
media, to store data. Your computer already comes with chips, of course. 
The motherboard contains some that house your device's system memory, 
or RAM, which is where information is stored and processed when your computer is running.

<h3>Parts</h3>
<!--Paragraph-->
<p><b>Device Driver(s)</b>-Software created by the OEM to run on the target host processor family under a particular OS and File System. The device driver provides host access the particular SSD product. 
<br>
<b>Interface Components</b>-The electrical interface between the host processor and the SSD peripheral device.
<br>
<b>SSD Controller</b>-The electronic component(s) that provide SSD device level interfacing and firmware execution. Included is an embedded processor, data ROM, data RAM, flash component interfacing, error correction code (ECC), wear leveling/TRIM, and security features.
<br>
<b>Buffer/Cache Components</b>-This is high speed RAM memory components used for speed matching and to increased data throughput.
<br>
<b>Controller Firmware</b>-Software written and stored in electrically erasable memory for execution by the controller. Can be upgraded once in service.
<br>
<b>Flash Memory Components</b>-Individual Flash die or devices using either NAND or NOR technology. Densities vary from 2GBytes to 64GBytes.
