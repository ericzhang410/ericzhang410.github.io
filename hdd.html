		<div id="brief"><!--Second div is of the description-->
    		<p> HDD or Hard Disk Drive is the primary storage device on most computers. 
            It stores non-volatile information and is often internally installed on computers.
            It is stored in the drive bay of a computer's case and is connected to the 
            motherboard via a SATA, SCSI, or an ATA cable.

	    <p>Of the four major components of any computer, storage is often the most overlooked. 
        However, storage is crucial as it includes all of a computer's files, 
        applications, documents, and even its operating system. A hard drive will save all of the documents you create, so you can go back later to access, preview, copy, 
        delete, or send them. In short, the function of HDD is very simple, to store data and retrieve them when asked.

	        <p>Below, there is a list of parts that most HDD have. Please note that items with 
	        an asterick indicates that this part is not neccesary and doesn't occur on all HDD
	        </p>
    	    <ul>
    	        <li>A platter (the disk that will store the 1s and 0s)</li>
    	        <li>A spindle (the circle in the middle of the disk to hold it together)</li>
                <li>A read/write arm (the metal rod that will control the movement of the read/write head,making sure they are in the correct position)</li>
                <li>An actuator (the smalle motor that moves the actuator arm)</li>
                <li>A case (the plastic box surrounding all the hardware)</li>
                <li>A SATA port (the place where you plug in the SATA connector from the motherboard)</li>
                <li>A power supply port (the place where you plug in a power connector from the Power Supply Unit)</li>
                <li>*A jumper port (the place where you plug in a jumper cable)</li>

	    <h1><a name="works">How HDD works</a></h1>
	    <p>HDDs work by spinning several high-speed platters or disks and using a read/write head to access them. Every disk has a film made of tiny magnetic grains that each have a magnetic polarity. A group of these magnetic grains is called a "bit" and will make up either a 1 or 0 depending on the polarity. 
	    </p>
	    <br>
	    <p>
	   To change the polarity of a bit, the write head will emit an electric current into an electromagnet which will change the polarity of a bit. To read a disk, the read head will sense the magnetic polarity of a bit and convert that to either a 1 or a 0.

	    <h1><a name="future">The future of HDD</a></h1>
	    <p>As seen from the Master Timeline of storage devices, HDD
        was one of the first forms of data storage in human history.
        What does that mean for HDD's future? Well just like how HDD
        replaced magnetic drums, there is a new and faster form of storage called SSD. It will, of course, take years if not decades for the average consumer to replace their old HDDs with newer SSD, 
        but slowly and surely, HDD sales will fall with each subsequent year.</p>
        <br>
        <p>However, this does not mean that HDD will become obsolete. A new technology called SMR (Shingled Magnetic Recording) has seen promising results. Companies like Western Digital have begun experimenting with SMR and have seen revolutionary 20TB disks. If we follow Moore's Law, the data capacity of HDD would double every 2-4 years! In truth, there is no sure way to predict what the future will hold. Maybe a new technology wipes out HDD overnight. Maybe HDD will remain the primary form of storage for the next decade. All we can do is be there and see for ourselves.</p>
