        	    <p>Punch cards were the first known instance of data being stored onto a sheet. They came before computers and were used by mechanized textile machines. You would poke a hole in a place on the sheet, feed it
                into the textile machine, and it would weave accordingly.</p>

        	    <p>Magnetic Drum Memory was invented in Austria in 1932. It was the main memory of most computers in the 1950s and 1960s. It worked by rapidly spinning a drum with indents on it. A scanner would check the surface of the drum, interpreting 1s and 0s. It spun at 12,500RPM and had a capacity of 10KB. </p>

                <p>The Selectron Tube was a handheld storage device. It was 10 inches long by 3 inches wide. It worked by storing digital data inside a vacuum tube, converting 1s and 0s to electrostatic charges. It was small unlike the other bulky storage machines at the time, however, it could only store up to 512 MB.

                <p>Magnetic tape was invented in 1951 and called UNISERVO. It was the main storage device on the UNIVAC 1 computer. It had a transfer rate of 7,200 characters a minute and could hold up to 1.5 MB per tape. However, the main reason why the UNISERVO was so important was that it was the precursor to the revolutionary cassette tape.</p>

                <p>The first Hard Disk Drive was invented by IBM for the IBM 305 RAMAC. It included 50 high-spinning 24" disks that could hold up to 5 MB, a big achievement for its time. However, it was extremely large, about the size of two refrigerators.</p>

                <p>The first Laserdisc had a diameter of 30cm and could hold up to 60 minutes of video. However, it was only commercially available in 1978 because of delays. It also faced a lot of competition with the Floppy Disk that had come out in 1967. However, these two disks would go on to inspire CDs, DVDs, Blu-Rays, and so many others.</p>

                <p>The first floppy disk was invented in 1967 by IBM. It was a read-only disk, meaning you couldn't write anything on it after manufacturing. It had a diameter of 8 inches and could hold up to 80KB. It was one of the major inspirations for the CD and DVD. Overall, a very crucial storage device. </p>

                <p>In the late 1960s, James T. Russel began experimenting with using light to store data. He used light to burn indents on a disk, then used a laser to scan for the indents and turn them into music. This technology caught the eye of Sony, who used Russel's technology to manufacture billions of CDs, DVDs, and Blu-Rays. Optical Disks were arguably the most important storage device of the 20th century, able to hold up to 700 MiB.</p>

                <p>Hard Disk Drives were some of the first forms of electronic data storage.  After constantly being developed and updated, Hard Disk Drives would finally enter their modern forms, the 3.5" HDD. By this time, HDDs were no longer the big and bulky machines, but thin, smooth, disks with extremely large areal data. They could store data in the gigabytes now, and slowly became the primary storage device on all computers. </p>

                <p>Optical Drives and HDD had dominated the storage market ever since its introduction in 1979. However, it all changed in 2000 when the Israeli company M-Systems created the Flash Drive. This tiny piece of hardware the size of your thumb could hold up to 8MB of non-volatile data. It could be put on the motherboard, or put in a compact USB thumb drive. Arguably, the most important innovation of the last decade when it comes to storage devices.</p>

                <p>While solid-state drives had been in the development since the 1950s, it was only since the early 1990s did the modern SSD take form. They were comparable to Flash Drives in size but could hold much more data and transfer data at much higher speeds. Unfortunately, SSDs were often overshadowed by the higher capacity HDD and shinier Optical Disks. It wasn't until 2003 when Apple decided to include an SSD on their new Macbook that it started getting the attention it deserves. Nowadays, SSD is often 3x as fast as HDD, while making no sound, and consuming barely any energy. SSD is the storage of the future.</p>

                <p>Cloud storage services were not a new concept. Companies such as AT&T  had similar services back in the mid-1990s where you pay a monthly fee to store a finite amount of data. Cloud storage worked by uploading information through the web to a companies' servers where they would store it. You could then retrieve the information at any time. However, cloud services only really started to gain attention in 2011 when Apple announced its Cloud System: iCloud. Unlike the monthly services, iCloud was 100% free to anyone who bought an Apple device from 2011 and onward. As of 2018, it had over 850 million users, but it's easy to see why. You can back up all your device's data with the click of a button, no fee, no long forms for you to sign. Even today, cloud storage is one of the most popular forms of storage.</p>

                <p>As the rate of new technology increases exponentially, there will always be a demand to store more data. There are a lot of new and promising storage device technologies and below, I will be talking about the 3 most interesting and unique.</p>

                <p>When most people think of holographs, they perceive some far-future technology, and that is indeed how holographic storage feels. This new technology will store bits by projecting lights. This can result in 3-dimensional storage, by shining light at different angles. This will mean that people will see a different series of bits depending on where they're standing. Although we don't have exact figures, scientists agree that Holographic Storage could be one of the next big storage devices. </p>

                <p>Moving on to arguably the most unique and futuristic of these 3, DNA Storage. Now, we all know about GMO foods and how scientists have been modifying DNA for the past decades, but now, technology companies have gotten into modifying DNA not to modify plants and animals, but to store bits! Just recently in 2016, Microsoft was able to store 1 zettabyte (1 billion TB) in 1 gram of DNA. It works by converting base 4 (A, T, C, G) into base 2 (Binary). The process is extremely time-consuming and expensive, costing about $2,000 to store 83 KB. However, if the DNA is kept in cool and dark conditions, the information stored could last for millions of years. We'll just have to wait and see how this revolutionary tech unfolds.</p>

                <p>At first glance, Helium Disk Drives look exactly like Hard Disk Drives. They have the same shape, same case, same size. However, inside the case of a Helium Disk Drive, you will find the disk surrounded not by air, but by helium. This is because helium is much lighter than air, 6x lighter in fact. This will mean that there is less friction and resistance when the disk is spinning, resulting in disk speeds 6x the current rate. Another reason a Helium Disk Drive would be far superior is the fact that helium is much harder to rise in temperature than air. This means that Helium Disk Drives would require little if not any cooling. If we combined a Helium Disk Drive with Shingled Magnetic Recording, HDD would be a formidable competitor to SSD.</p>
