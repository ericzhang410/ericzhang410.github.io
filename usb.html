    		<p> USB Flash Drives or USB Sticks store non-volatile information on a Flash Drive. They connect to a computer via the USB connector and are primarily used to quickly transfer large amounts of data from one electronic device to another. As long as there is a need to move data around, USB Flash Drives will always be the most reliable and efficient. USB Flash Drives are cheap, small, and can store an extremely large amount of data depending on the model. Special USBs can even transfer data between two completely different electronic devices!

	    <h1><a name="functions">Functionalities of USB Flash Drives</a></h1><!--This div is of the functions-->
	    <p>The function of a USB Flash Drive is very simple, to transfer data from one electronic device to another. They can be used to store files, photos, videos, presentations, and spreadsheets. USBs also excel at transferring data from one place to another. Email may be used, but USBs are simply more private and secure, while also having the ability to transfer large files or multiple large files. The last major function USBs serve is to backup your computer. When you buy a new computer to replace your old one, USBs can be used to move all your data. When you're afraid your computer might crash and delete all your files, backups help by adding that extra layer of security. You can quickly download a file from your computer, and plug it in a different PC to get the same data USB.

    	        <li>A USB connector (to connect the flash drive to the device)</li>
    	        <li>A USB mass storage controller (a microcontroller to regulate what data goes in or out)</li>
                <li>An NAND Flash memory chip (this is where all the data will actually be stored)</li>

	    <h1><a name="works">How a USB Flash Drive works</a></h1><!--Nested List-->
	    <p>USB Flash Drives start when you plug in the USB connector into the port of an electronic device like a computer. If receiving information from the computer, the computer will emit either a low voltage current or a high voltage current into the NAND Flash Memory Chip. To determine whether the computer is sending a 1 or a 0, the electric current will pass through a floating gate Mosfet which uses a system of positively and negatively charged metal oxides. If an electron passes through the floating gates and metal oxides, a low voltage charge is required. This represents a 0. If the electrons build resistance at the floating gate, a high voltage charge is needed. This represents a 1. When transferring data from the USB Flash Drive into the computer, the NAND Flash Memory Chip will emit the charges.

	    <h1><a name="future">The future of USB Flash Drives</a></h1><!--Last div is for the future of usbs-->
	    <p>USB 4/USBC is the USB model on most modern androids and laptops. With a data transfer speed of 40 GB/s, this seems to be the future connector type for USB flash drives. However, it will take at least 2 years for USB 4 to get implemented on all forms of computers and laptops.
Capacity will also increase, as most USB Flash Drives will begin measuring capacity in the terabytes. Unlike connector types, capacity will only increase with new technologies, until USB flash drives in the terabytes will be affordable for the average consumer. Future trends seem to point to size remaining roughly the same, however, there will always be outliers.</p>
